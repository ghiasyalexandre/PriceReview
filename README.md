# Price Review (Website)

# Product Vision

For all retail consumers, this product is intended to allow buyers to make informed decisions on 
purchases, by having the most up to date information on restocks, prices and overall quality. 
The product goes by the name Price Review , which is used through a website that is easily accessible
by consumers which leads to a large target audience that can benefit both businesses and buyers. 
Unlike normal sites like Amazon, where reviews for products aren't that integral to their platform 
to allow users to have the best information before receiving the product as sometimes the reviews
are vague, or also biased since there are reports that amazon 3rd party sellers sometimes 
pay for reviews to be 5 star as a way to beat the algorithm rankings. 
Our product offers a complete way to view every aspect of a product unbiasedly that is in hot demand,
and allows consumers to chat with one another.

## Task Allocation

For this week we got together this week and we set up the work enviroment for the team. We also made changes to the trello as a group to set out an outline of the tasks we need to accomplish. The tasks we are working on as a group include to create the development enviroment. We also need to set up a database for the information that we will need to store, and eventually we are going to push a "hello world" program to test that everything is working properly.
